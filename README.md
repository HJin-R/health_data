Health data clssification using machine learning algorithms
 
### Classic machine learning algorithms
- Logistic Regression: lightweight and suitable for simple, linearly separable problems when interpretability is crucial
- SVM: best for complex problems with high-dimensional data
- Random Forest: complex problems specifically for robust and generalised predictions
- Ridge Classifier: good for problems with correlated features
